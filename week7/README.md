Part 2:

The two tracks do match quite well, which makes sense considering they are from the same experiment but just use different sequencing methods. Some small regions are missing from one track but present in the other, but not many.

Part 3a:

Shared sites: 4296642
ONT only: 53346
Bisulfite only: 132466
Jaccard Index: 0.9585468

Q2: Bisulfite sequencing has more depth on the histogram; therefore by this metric it appears better.

Q3: ONT sequencing seems to reveal more pronounced changes in methylation between the tumor and the normal sample; it might therefore be better at detecting methylation.

Q4: Tumorigenesis seems to significantly alter methylation patterns, causing some loci to become more methylated while others lose methylation.

Q5: There seem to be significantly altered patterns of methylation in this gene between the tumor and normal samples; this could have an affect on chromatin accessibility and therefore alter expression of DNA methyltransferase.

Q6: Imprinting of a gene is an epigenetic change (such as methylation) that can differ between paternally and maternally contributed chromosomes. 

Q7: Phasing the reads separates the reads by parental origin. 

Q8: Not any set of reads can be phased; haploid reads cannot, and highly repetitive sequences can introduce ambiguity.
